Open the Personalization.ipynb in Azure notebooks. 

Copy actionfeatures.json, example.json, rankrequest.json to the same folder. 

Make sure you update the personalization_base_url and subscription_key with your valid endpoints. (Please note that after you provision a Personalizer instance, it could take some time for the instance to be ready. Please check the Settings menu blade. If it displays the settings correctly, it means that the instance is ready.)
