    "World No.1 Naomi Osaka joins the WTA Insider Podcast after her Australian Open triumph to reflect on her rapid rise to the top of the women's game.",
    "019 Australian Open champion and newly-minted WTA World No.1 Naomi Osaka joins the WTA Insider Podcast to reflect on her hard-fought title-run in Melbourne, which saw her defeat three Top 10 players to become the first woman in nearly 18 years to win her first two majors titles back-to-back.",
    "\"I called my mom after I did all the press,\" Osaka said on the WTA Insider Podcast. \"She didn't even say congratulations. She just yelled at me to go to sleep. So I felt really loved,\" she said with a smile.",
    "\"I feel like for the past two years, all I really wanted to do was to be in the Top 10 because I thought that's how you make a name for yourself. To be in this position now is really unreal. I feel like I want to do well during the entire year and not just the hardcourt tournaments.\"",
    "The 21-year-old's 7-6(2), 5-7, 6-4 win over Petra Kvitova in Saturday's final ensured Osaka would become the first Asian player - man or woman - to hold the singles No.1 ranking and the youngest since Caroline Wozniacki in 2010 to debut at the WTA top spot. Osaka takes over the No.1 position from reigning Roland Garros champion Simona Halep, who held the No.1 spot for 48 consecutive weeks."
